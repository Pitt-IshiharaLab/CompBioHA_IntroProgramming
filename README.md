# Intro to Programming 2024

This site provides the material for the "Intro to Programming" course for students participating in the CompBio Hillman Academy 2024.

The course provides a basic hands-on lesson in programming using Python and examples from compuational biology. No previous programming knowledge is assumed. This is NOT a comprehensive intro course in programming. Rather we hope students gets excited about combining programming and biology in their future research!

**Instructors**:

 -	Luisa Fernanda Escobar-Robledo (PhD student, [CPCB](https://www.compbio.cmu.edu/))
 - Keisuke Ishihara (Assistant Professor, [Computational and Systems Biology](https://www.csb.pitt.edu/))
 - Chris Morii-Sciolla (PhD student, [IBGP](https://www.gradbiomed.pitt.edu/))
