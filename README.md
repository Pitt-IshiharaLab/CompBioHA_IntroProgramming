# Intro to Programming 2024

This site provides the material for the "Intro to Programming" course for students participating in the CompBio Hillman Academy 2024.

The course provides a basic hands-on lesson in programming using Python and examples from compuational biology. No previous programming knowledge is assumed.
This is NOT a comprehensive intro course in programming.
We hope that this course gets students excited about combining programming and quantitative thinking in their biology research!
